# Kimai 2 - Invoice templates

Some example invoice templates for the Kimai 2 time-tracker.

They are meant to be demonstration for the different renderer types.

Please read the official documentation at [https://www.kimai.org/documentation/invoices.html](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/invoices.html) to find out more about building your own invoice templates.

## Installation

Create the directory `var/invoices/` in your Kimai installation:

```
cd /kimai2/
mkdir var/invoices/
```

Then copy the files from this repository into this directory.

They should show now up in your "Invoice templates" administration.
